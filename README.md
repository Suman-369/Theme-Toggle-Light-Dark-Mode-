# 🌗 Theme Toggle Mood (Light / Dark Mode)

This project demonstrates a Theme Toggle System using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It automatically detects the user's system theme preference (light or dark) and allows manual switching with a toggle button.
The chosen theme is stored in localStorage, so the preference is saved across sessions.
